Understanding is a psychological process related to an abstract
or physical object, such as a person, situation, or message
whereby one is able to think about it and use concepts to
deal adequately with that object. Understanding is a relation
between the knower and an object of understanding.
Understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect
to an object of knowledge that are sufficient to support
intelligent behaviour.

Understanding is often, though not always, related to learning
concepts, and sometimes also the theory or theories associated
with those concepts. However, a person may have a good ability
to predict the behaviour of an object, animal or system—and
therefore may, in some sense, understand it—without necessarily
being familiar with the concepts or theories associated with
that object, animal or system in their culture. They may have
developed their own distinct concepts and theories, which may
be equivalent, better or worse than the recognised standard
concepts and theories of their culture. Thus, understanding is
correlated with the ability to make inferences.
